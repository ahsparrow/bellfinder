Bell Finder - A directory of bell towers for change ringers

Copyright (C) 2020  Alan Sparrow

Bell Finder summarises of the details of the more than 7000 bell towers
with rings of three or more bells. The app also allows you to record
details of any visits.

Bell Finder uses the Dove data file from the Central Council of Church
Bellringers (CCCBR). The file (app/src/main/assets/dove.txt) is a
modified version of the CCCBR's original with the addition of an
integer tower identification key and the removal some unused fields.
The file is distributed under a Creative Commons license (see below.)

The tower map is rendered using the osmdroid library, see
https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid. This is distributed under the
Apache license.

The fast scroller is implemented using the RecyclerView-FastScroller
library, see
